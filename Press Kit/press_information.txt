--- Why Create Habitually? ---
The concept of a learning journal intrigued me—the idea that each day could lend its knowledge to the present was fascinating. I wanted to test if it was possible to translate such data into actionable knowledge and lessons, enabling me to live according to my wants and expectations.



--- How Habitually is Made ---
For this experimental project, I established the entire app's backend to work off Firebase's Realtime Database. I chose to natively develop Habitually for Android using Android Studio.

Habitually comprises two main pillars:
The base application that functions as a data-driven journal.
Features related to driving insights and illustrating these to the user, serving their curiosity and personal journey.
The goal is to create an intuitive and quick interface, making it easy for anyone to journal their daily lives. Additionally, Habitually uses Machine Learning to jumpstart people’s analysis and reflection on their lives according to their own wants and expectations.



--- Why Release Habitually? ---
What began as a personal project quickly gained traction after sharing it on a data forum on Reddit. With 2 million views and hundreds of downloads within a few days, it became clear that Habitually’s dual purpose as a habit tracker/journal and a well-being mood tracker was an evolution in journaling and accountability tools that people wanted.
